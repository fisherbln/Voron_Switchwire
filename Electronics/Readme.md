To Wire ECRF Board for Stealthburner:
If running klicky, then on the ercf board you can connect klicky to x endstop header, LEDs to the filament sensor header, and the filament sensor can go to the probe header since the hall filament sensor can run on 24v ..then you should be able to have LEDs, ERCF and klicky all at the same time
